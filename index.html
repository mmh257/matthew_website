      <p>Hi! I'm a recent graduate of Cornell University with a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical & Computer Engineering.
        I love solving complex problems and I'm interested in computer architecture, design verification, and VLSI with 
        a goal of becoming an ASIC architect. Throughout my undergrad, I've taken a wide variety of courses spanning nearly
        all branches of ECE including: Computer Architecture and ASIC Design (Digital), Analog IC Design and Advanced VLSI 
        Analog Design (Analog), Digital Signal Processing & Statistical Inference and Signals & Systems (DSP), Microcontroller Design 
        and Embedded Systems (Embedded).
      </p> <br> 
      <p>In July, I'll be starting work as a Design Verification Engineering working on verification of various memory 
            subsystems. I'm excited to use everything I've learned from school & past experiences to learn what it takes 
            to become a great Verification Engineer and learn relevant industry standard tools like UVM and SV.</p> <br> 
      <p>Outside of engineering, I love hiking, exploring national parks, playing pickleball and Ultimate Frisbee!
        I'm always looking for fun pickup ultimate frisbee or new hiking trails to explore.

        <p> During my time at Keysight Technologies,
            I created a block design, RTL modules and conducted 
            first pass verification of a small block for an upcoming ASIC. 
            This project highlights many of the 
            steps across the ASIC design process, starting from translating specifications 
            into a block design, then moving to conducting RTL design applying synthesizable 
            principles while co-designing these blocks through various testbenches for verification. 
            At a high level, the block I designed and worked on is a demuxer with additional 
            FIFO logic where it serves as a buffer point between two different regions of the 
            chip - a single streamed input and a 16-stream output. RTL modules and submodules 
            were assembled using verilog, using synthesizable and efficient design where 
            applicable while testbenches and golden modules for verification were built 
            with SystemVerilog and Python. </p>

        <p>This was my final project for ECE 6745, Complex ASIC Design taught by Professor Christopher Batten, where 
            I implemented a basic Modified-Invalid cache coherence protocol for a two cache system. In this project, 
            I implemented a custom interconnect in verilog and modified pre-developed caches from previous labs to 
            support proper tagging of cachelines as modified / invalid for cache coherence. I also developed custom 
            test harness and Python models using the PyMTL3 framework to validate my RTL designs. Once these designs were 
            developed, they were pushed through the backend ASIC flow starting from synthesis to place and route and then 
            subsequently verified through ffgl and bagl tests through Synopsys VCS and Cadence Innovus tools.

        <p> This project was a self-project exploration of how GPUs work. I implemented a simple GPU, modeling the 
            streaming multiprocessor units found in NVIDIA GPUs which contains 4 cores, each capable of performing 
            4-thread vector wide processes. Each core itself has 4 compute units which are individual ALUs, Register Files, 
            and load store units with shared a shared fetcher and decoder. MiniGPU is a very simple GPU with no 
            wave pooling or branch prediction and I created a custom 12-set ISA consisting of atomic operations such 
            as load, store, add, sub, multiplying, register loading, and more. Once all of the components were developed 
            in RTL, two kernels using the custom ISA were written to verify that the module works for vector addition 
            and matrix multiplication.
